			<p><em>MY NAME IS JUICE</em></p> 
			<p><i>This is my backstory</i></p>  </nav>
			<p>I thought of becoming many things as a kid. Little did I realize that every new small business I started or new page I started, the design process was always my favorite part. I have always had a passion for art and, always tried my hardest with each art project. I always try to learn something new to increase my skills and usefulness. I have always knew my way around electronics. This one skill alone has helped me a lot in my daily design life at home and school. As I got older the nickname that was given to me by my parents ( JUICE ) was neglected by me. When I learned more about graphic design, I was immediately hooked and, decided to actually learn it. That's when I decided I was going to be a graphic design artist one way or another, I also knew this was the perfect way to fully embrace the name " JUICE ". Since that day I have slowly been building myself a platform on the internet. I have been working on my graphic design skills crafting profile pictures and thumbnails for my own content. Slowly increasing my design skills with each project, while building a following! I began to expand my project types, I started to design memes, stickers and, sometimes clothes. Once I reached high school, I entered an actual graphic design classroom, with my favorite design teacher. This classroom would end up introducing me to, the Adobe Software and Adobe Cloud. This newly acquired set of programs, set me up to expand extremely, while producing such higher quality. For my first 2 years of highschool I worked with Illustrator and learned the basics of graphic design. I trained my eyes to see the slightest in shade/tone shifts, I also learned balance of typography and logos. By the second year, I wanted to mixit up a little so, I started to take studio photos and just photos of myself in general for a modeling portfolio, while also using these photo for graphics along the way. The final two years of high school was when I focused on my photoshop skills. I also began finding clients and doing all types of crazy fun projects. I would find myself working on a logo design one period and an album cover the next. No request was completely shut down without a full discussion of the ideas and goals of each party. I will always be willing to work and communicate with a client to better fit my clients needs and goals. I never promised work I knew/or just wasn't confident I was skilled enough to complete. I love see all of my project through to the end. whether, the project take 2yrs and 7 trys or 2 days and 1 try! I hope by the end of this you have better understand who you will be working with and, decided to work with me. Although, if you already have worked with me, make sure to always stay in touch. I'm always ready for that next big project and keeping in touch with past clients. Once you come in contact with me, you become part of my journey and although, I would love to turn every client that comes my way to a business partner for the long run, not every project needs a squeal but, you will forever be Juice Familia.</p>
